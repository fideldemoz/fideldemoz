> I am a Self-taught Software developer specializing in `JavaScript`. I am currently working on my skills until I become a Full-stack Software Developer.  
# My Story
In 2020, I entered university ([Eduardo Mondlane University](https://www.uem.mz)) to study Bachelor degree in English as a Second Language (ESL) Teaching. Three years after, early in 2023, I realised Teaching English isn't the carrer I really fell like holding. So, I joined [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and it al began!  
# My Expertise

That's it. I am working on becoming an Expert in Js. Of course, I am still a fresher. Maybe check again later, I will be a Js monster by then.
